Hi there 🙌! 
I’m Mayank and I’m currently pursuing my Masters in Business Analytics(MSBA) from UMN Carlson School of Management. 

I have five years of working experience in Analytics and Data Science. 

My journey in Analytics started as a Decision Scientist at MuSigma (Bangalore) where I solved interesting problems for our Fortune 500 clients for 3.5 years. 

Post that, I was working at Walmart as a Senior Data Analyst for 1.5 years where my role revolved around recommending in-demand items to sellers to onboard on walmart.com, using different customer demand signals. 

_Fun Fact - In case you purchased an item from Walmart in the last couple of years, there is a high chance that item was recommended by me! _

👨‍💼: Interested in Data Science related roles
